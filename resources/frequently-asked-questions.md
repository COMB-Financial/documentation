### Are you making NFT’s and if so will they have utility?

Yes, we are going to be releasing NFT’s that hold utility.

### Is COMB a defi-as-a-service (DaaS) or a node-as-a-service (NaaS)?

COMB is a hybrid of both DaaS and NaaS, while we still have some roots in the defi space we do create real physical nodes like a NaaS.

### Are Comb Nodes (Hives) real nodes?

Yes, these are real nodes. We are hosting and providing the infrastructure of real nodes to the people as compensation for their investment. These nodes are full nodes or ‘read only’. Read only nodes provide users the ability to connect to the blockchain via their unique RPC code.&#x20;

This type of node provides no monetary value to the users but has other benefits such as quicker transaction speed and lower gas fees because only you and anyone you give your unique Comb RPC code to will utilize your pathway on the fantom chain!&#x20;

For those that are truly bee-lievers, when you have multiple endpoints, it will automatically generate you a UNIVERSAL ENDPOINT. The difference between your single node endpoint and a UNIVERSALENDPOINT. Your universal endpoint will utilize all your node endpoints to find the quickest path to complete the transaction on the fantom network.&#x20;

NO OTHER PROJECT OFFERS UNIVERSAL ENDPOINTS FOR ALL YOUR NODES.&#x20;

### What are endpoints for and do we need to use them to generate income with our nodes?

Endpoints are used to speed up your Metamask and it’s transactions, you don’t need to generate your node endpoints to yield rewards, it is an optional feature.

### Are you listed on Coingecko or Coin market cap?

Yes we are listed on both.

### What is the max number of nodes per wallet?

100 nodes per wallet is the current max.

### **Do I need to keep my computer running?**

No, you do not need to keep your computer running. A node is hosted on hardware once your hive generates an endpoint.

### **Do I need to generate an endpoint to be compensated with rewards?**

No, you do not need to generate an endpoint. Endpoints are purely a real world utility for those who would like to utilize their node at its fullest extent.

### What is $NECT (NECTAR)?

The goal of $NECT is to provide a method for reaching new nodes faster. As far as other uses go, since $NECT has no true value, BUT is pegged 1:1 with $COMB, it's a way of getting around the "income tax" in some countries. Since $NECT holds 0 monetary value, it's taxing 0$ of income. I'm not a financial expert, or tax advisor, but logically speaking it makes sense. With no liquidity pool for $NECT selling isn't an option, however, you can send it to and from holders. Convert $NECT to a node at any time you have enough to build your desired hive.&#x20;

You must wait at least 10 days for the lowest tax bracket to earn the most $COMB. However, if you earn enough in rewards to build another node in less than 10 days, $NECT allows you the option to build another node as soon as you hit 9/30/60 accumulated rewards at 0% tax.&#x20;

Right now, $NECT is strictly designed for rewarding those who compound.&#x20;

Future uses may be built to incentives further holding of $NECT.&#x20;

❗️❗️❗️PLEASE NOTE❗️❗️❗️

There is a method to emergency unwrap your $NECT to $COMB. However, the fee for doing so is 75%.&#x20;

For more information on $NECT, please read our medium article: [https://blog.comb.financial/our-innovative-compounding-solution-with-nectar-b73af0a490e4](https://blog.comb.financial/our-innovative-compounding-solution-with-nectar-b73af0a490e4)

### What is Comb?

COMB is a token that is used to enter the COMB Financial ecosystem of projects built on top of the Fantom network. At the moment, COMB financial has deployed a single protocol that aims to fund a single community validator to help the decentralization of the Fantom network.&#x20;

We aim to further deploy more projects and protocols onto the Fantom network. We plan on creating NFT projects, games, and DAOs under COMB.

To learn more about who we are, head over to our medium articles: [https://blog.comb.financial/](https://blog.comb.financial)

### Why did you start Comb?

The main reason we decided to start COMB was to initially create a node based service, similar to STRONG. However, as we started growing we dived deeper into our understanding of the Fantom network and we realized and appreciated the advancements in technology that Fantom provided. Although the network is so great, we learned as well that the ecosystem of projects was tiny. As of writing, there are only 66 validators whereas other networks are much more decentralized due to their numerous miners on the network. Furthermore, we decided that we wanted to be a foundation for an ecosystem of projects all based upon the Fantom network in order to uplift this network which we love and care about.

### How does Comb generate revenue?

COMB generates revenue through two factors, buy pressure and its validator. Although the rewards may be low at first, we believe that achieving our mission statement is the number one reason our protocol exists.

### Does COMB have a FTM validator node?

Yes

### How does the Tax system work?

COMB has a dynamic tax system based on the amount of COMB you can claim. If you surpass a certain amount of COMB to claim you move to the next tax bracket. The amount needed can be found in the tax table and depends on what type of Hives you hold.

From this we can derive the following numbers:&#x20;

Each Broughton hive adds 0.15500403 COMB to the total needed amount for the 19% tax bracket and needs 0.24801147 to get into the 5% tax bracket&#x20;

Each Top Bar hive adds 0.500013 COMB to the total needed amount for the 19% tax bracket and needs 0.800037 to get into the 5% tax bracket&#x20;

Each Langstroth hive adds 1.7500455 COMB to the total needed amount for the 19% tax bracket and needs 2.8001295 to get into the 5% tax bracket&#x20;

Each Warre hive adds 3.56009256 COMB to the total needed amount for the 19% tax bracket and needs 5.69626344 to get into the 5% tax bracket

If you happen to buy a Broughton at some point later on you take the 5.2002405 and add the amount needed for a Broughton and you will get 5.2002405 + 0.24801147 = 5.44825197 COMB needed for the 5% bracket.

❗️NOTE❗️: The tax is based on how much COMB you can claim so it does not matter how much or long each of your hives has produced as long as all rewards together are enough to be above the required amount.

### Why Tax the claiming of COMB?

This has several reasons.&#x20;

The first reason is to encourage people to compound towards a next hive since the Nectar route is not taxed (see NECTar for more details).&#x20;

The second reason is to reduce the total number of sell actions. While the dynamic system will not stop the total sold amount of COMB directly it will make it, so people make sells with more COMB at the same time, this makes a more balanced chart since the buy for a new hive is also a larger amount than 1 day or rewards.

### What happens with the claim Tax?

The claim tax for COMB is actually not send anywhere. What happens when you claim is you get your rewards paid from a rewards pool. The tax just makes it, so some part is left behind in the pool. To know why we tax if it does not go anywhere except back in the pool see: "Why Tax the claiming of COMB?"

### What happens to my $COMB or $NECT when I create a Node?

Your tokens are used like so:

60% is redistributed&#x20;

10% is liquidity&#x20;

3% goes to marketing&#x20;

2% goes to core team&#x20;

25% left goes to the treasury

### When did the project launch?

December 19th, 2021.

### What is the purpose of verifying our nodes in discord #access-bot ?

Discord integration is a huge step in becoming a true dao, by having our discord linked with our hives we can guarentee all people holding roles are node holders as well, so we don't have any "bad eggs" swinging votes when we do dao votes.

### Is the current redistribution system set like a Ponzi?

To avoid ponzinomics we set strict missions. We will not recirculate money as that is a literal ponzi. From a legal and dictionary standpoint, we are NOT a ponzi.

### How do I verify my nodes to earn unique discord roles and vote in upcoming Hive holder events?

1\) Go to [https://app.comb.financial/](https://app.comb.financial)&#x20;

2\) Scroll to the bottom of the page & click "Sync with Discord"&#x20;

3\) Click Authorize&#x20;

4\) Verify with Discord

5\) Go to access-bot & type '!verify' you will then be assigned your role

### Is there an audit? When will there be an audit?

1. There isn't an audit yet.
2. There will be an audit after the team considers the additions to the contract to be finished. There is no point doing an audit right now since the goals for Comb will change the contract going forward. We want to save treasury funds to aquire the FTM validator and other means of generating revenue for the protocol to support long term sustainability.

### Is the contract going to be viewable or open source?

The contract will be private until the audit is complete.

### What is the point of Comb Endpoints?

Step 1: The purpose behind the Comb Endpoints is to allow a different pathway to and from the FTM network. When the default pathway gets congested, you know your pathway is always open since only you and whoever you want to have access to it, have access.

Step 2: Universal endpoints. Universal endpoints are available for anyone who has multiple nodes. The universal endpoint will utalize all your end points generated by your nodes to find the fastest route to complete your transaction.

Step 3: US/EU selection. Allowing Combers to select US/EU on their end points this will further reduce latency, increase speed, reduce fees.

### How can I use both $COMB and $NECT to build a node?

In 4 easy steps!:

1. Claim your current rewards earned into $NECT. The reason for this is because you keep all your earned rewards when claiming to $NECT since it will always have a 0% claim tax.

2\. Convert any held $COMB from your wallet to $NECT. $COMB is pegged 1:1 to $NECT.

3\. Build your node utilizing your $NECT balance:

4\. Enjoy more rewards in $COMB with your $NECT built node.

❗️❗️❗️ALL NODES WILL PAY OUT IN $COMB REGARDLESS OF BUILT METHOD. (I.E. BUILT WITH $COMB OR $NECT) ❗️❗️❗️

### What is an OTC?

An OTC stands for Over The Counter. It's usually talking in terms of a deal made between two parties. In this case, a larger investor and Comb Financial. It allows the larger investor the ability to work directly with the team to provide each party with what they desire.

If a larger investor buys 100k worth of a token with small liquidity, price in our case would jump anywhere between 20-30%. Sounds good right? But imagine if it's reversed. After accumulating large amounts of rewards, they decide to sell. We could see a 20-30% decrease in price.

The purpose is to allow larger investors the ability to invest, without shaking up the price of COMB. In short terms, OTC deals provide stability to the price overall.

### How does Comb conduct their OTC deals?



When a large investors comes to us and request to conduct an OTC deal, either selling or buying, we first have to discuss a few important details:

1. Time - The time we want to lock in the market price for the deal to be conducted. This is important since we won't be utilizing the liquidity pool for the trade of assets.
2. Date - The date the deal is to be conducted, which will always be within the boundaries of our agreements to ensure their isn't a large difference in the Time of market valued agreed, and the trade of assets conducted.
3. Agreement - An agreement is conducted between investor and Comb that states if the Time of market value exceeds 5% more or less than the agree upon Time, the Time of market value will be changed to prevent buying/selling at a large discount.

### What token do OTC deals conduct in?

In the case of a large buy order, the team will sell in $NECT. The team can sell in $NECT since it's not really a sale, but a trade of assets. If an investor is interested in investing with us, it should be for the intention of building nodes at this point. The purpose of $NECT is to build nodes.

In the case of a large sell, Comb Financial will purchase the investors assets in $COMB. Ensuring all holders are subject to the tax system, regardless of investor size.
