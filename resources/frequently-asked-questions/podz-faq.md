### What is the Claim, Feed and Health Bar functions on my PODZ?

* “Claim” — Like the name, sending a claim transaction is as it sounds: claiming your rewards from the Pod. The distribution of rewards occurs daily and will show on your Pod when it has received rewards. What happens during that downtime? All Podz over that time will be mining for your rewards.
* “Feed” — To maintain these daily rewards, you will have to feed your Pod to hold your position in COMB. As indicated by the health bar, we recommend all Pod holders to feed their Pod when it reaches 70–80%. Maintaining good health is essential to maximizing your wealth and daily rewards. This does not require any additional cost.
* “Health Bar” — The health bar represents your position within COMB. Given that you maintain a steady and healthy Pod, the Pod will maintain a stable and maximized daily rewards rate.

### How does the feed system work?

On pod creation 3 $COMB tokens are liquidated and moved into either the Scream and Boo pools to farm $COMB on the back-end, this farmed $COMB is available for you to use to keep your pod healthy.

### Do I have to add $COMB from my wallet to feed my pod?

No the $COMB used for feeding podz is farmed on the back-end through liquidity mining.

### What happens if my PODZ health goes to 0%?

If a Pod goes to 0%, the Pod **does not** die. It will still be mining for rewards but will not generate as many rewards as a healthy Pod.

### What is a POD?

Podz by definition, is an fNFT. Taking the existing concept of noding, we merge the convenience of passive income and zCOMB technology. Podz is our take on innovating the “typical” Node.

### How are PODZ sustainable?

Podz are backed by a complex system of revenue-generating services streaming all back into each Pod. Powered by zCOMB technology, it adapts the infrastructure to create a passive income stream without the complexity.&#x20;

### How do I feed my POD?

You feed a pod by clicking the "Feed" button. This will automatically move COMB into the pod to keep it healthy.

### How do PODZ pay out in $BTC, $ETH and $FTM?

Out of the 10 $COMB tokens used to create a pod, 6 of the are locked into our zCOMB system, this lock generates rewards daily, those rewards are then sold for either $BTC, $ETH or $FTM and sent to your rewards.

### When do PODZ pay out?

Your first rewards will be distributed at the end of the next zCOMB epoch, then at the end of each epoch after that. Rewards are distributed daily.
