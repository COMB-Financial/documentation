### What is the Claim, Feed and Health Bar functions on my PODZ?

* “Claim” — Like the name, sending a claim transaction is as it sounds: claiming your rewards from the Pod. The distribution of rewards occurs daily and will show on your Pod when it has received rewards. What happens during that downtime? All Podz over that time will be mining for your rewards.
* “Feed” — To maintain these daily rewards, you may have to feed your Pod to hold your position in COMB. As indicated by the health bar, we recommend all Pod holders to feed their Pod when it reaches 70–80%. Maintaining good health is essential to maximizing your wealth and daily rewards. This does not require any additional cost.
* “Health Bar” — The health bar represents your position within COMB. Given that you maintain a steady and healthy Pod, the Pod will maintain a stable and maximized daily rewards rate.

### What happens if my PODZ health goes to 0%?

If a Pod goes to 0%, the Pod **does not** die. It will still be mining for rewards but will not generate as many rewards as a healthy Pod.

### What is a POD?

Podz by definition, is an fNFT. Taking the existing concept of noding, we merge the convenience of passive income and zCOMB technology. Podz is our take on innovating the “typical” Node.

### How are PODZ sustainable?

Podz are backed by a complex system of revenue-generating services streaming all back into each Pod. Powered by zCOMB technology, it adapts the infrastructure to create a passive income stream without the complexity.&#x20;

Podz do not rely on Ponzinomics but instead realizes its rewards through the zCOMB infrastructure.

40% - 200%. The APR is dynamic and subject to change according to the zCOMB infrastructure.

### What is the max amount of PODZ per wallet?

5 of each kind of POD, 15 PODZ maximum per wallet.

### What is the maximum number of PODZ allowed to be created?

1500 PODZ is the current cap.

### How do I feed my POD?

You feed a pod by clicking the "Feed" button. This will automatically move COMB into the pod to keep it healthy.

### How does the whitelist presale work?

The whitelist **allows you to enter the pre-sale**, but does not guarantee a pod. If 20 of the 150 whitelisted users buys up 15 podz, then rest of the whitelisted members will have to participate in the public launch to purchase theirs.
