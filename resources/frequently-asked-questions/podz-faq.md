### What is the Claim, Feed, Compound and Health Bar functions on my Podz?

* “Claim” — Like the name, sending a claim transaction is as it sounds: claiming your rewards from the Pod. The distribution of rewards occurs daily and will show on your Pod when it has received rewards. What happens during that downtime? All Podz over that time will be mining for your rewards.
* “Feed” — To maintain these daily rewards, you will have to feed your Pod to hold your position in COMB. Maintaining good health is essential to maximizing your wealth and daily rewards. This does not require any additional cost. You should feed your Pod in order to sustain it's APR at a rate you are happy with.&#x20;
* “Compound” — This is a combined "Claim" and "Feed" action, which will redeposit all rewards back into the Pod for continual maximum rewards.
* “Health Bar” — The health bar represents your position within COMB. Given that you maintain a steady and healthy Pod, the Pod will maintain a stable and maximized daily rewards rate. The health, and also Pod APR will decrease linearly over to years.

On V1 pod creation 3 $COMB tokens are liquidated and moved into either the Scream and Boo pools to farm $COMB on the back-end, this farmed $COMB is available for you to use to keep your pod healthy.

No the $COMB used for feeding podz is farmed on the back-end through liquidity mining.

Your first rewards will be distributed at the end of the next zCOMB epoch, then at the end of each epoch after that. Rewards are distributed daily.
