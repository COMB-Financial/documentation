### Where does my $COMB go once a Capsule is created?

* All of the $COMB is locked into zCOMB in order to generate rewards for you.

### What is the Claim, Feed, Compound and Health Bar functions on my Capsule?

* “Claim” — Like the name, sending a claim transaction is as it sounds: claiming your rewards from the Capsule. The distribution of rewards occurs daily and will show on your Capsule when it has received rewards.
* “Feed” — To maintain these daily rewards, you will have to feed your Capsule to hold your position in COMB. Maintaining good health is essential to maximizing your wealth and daily rewards. This does not require any additional cost. You should feed your Capsule in order to sustain it's APR at a rate you are happy with.&#x20;
* “Compound” — This is a combined "Claim" and "Feed" action, which will redeposit all rewards back into the Capsule for continual maximum rewards.
* “Health Bar” — The health bar represents your position within COMB. Given that you maintain a steady and healthy Capsule, the Capsule will maintain a stable and maximized daily rewards rate. The health, and also Capsule APR will decrease linearly over to years.
