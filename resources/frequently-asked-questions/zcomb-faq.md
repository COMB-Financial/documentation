# zCOMB FAQ

### **How does my locked COMBy, zCOMB, and my APR correlate?**&#x20;

The longer you lock your COMB up for, the greater the amount of zCOMB is allocated to you and the higher your APR. With a two year lock, you get the full APR. With a one year lock, you get half the stated APR.

You canâ€™t withdraw before the locking period is over.&#x20;

### **If I claim and lock 1 $COMB today, then claim and lock 1 $COMB again tomorrow, how much time is added to my locking period?**&#x20;

If your locking period is 2 weeks or under then 1 week is added to your locking period every time you claim extra COMB from your hives. If it is over 2 weeks it simply adds that value to your existing locking period with no extra time.&#x20;
