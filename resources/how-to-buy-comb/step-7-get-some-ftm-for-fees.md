# Step 7: Get some FTM for fees

You will be transacting within the Fantom network for the remaining steps. All transactions within any network require fees to be paid in that networks’ native token. Therefore, we will need a small amount on Fantom (FTM) for fees before we can proceed any further. A Fantom faucet gives us small amounts of FTM for fees at no charge.

A fantom faucet can be accessed by going to [https://www.mentasuave01-tools.com/](https://www.mentasuave01-tools.com) in your brower and following the steps below:
