COMB Nodes were a fundamental part of the early COMB ecosystem, nodes can no longer be created but will be turned into NFT's which can be bought and sold on a secondary market.

**Benefits for node holders:**

* Nodes emit $COMB every 4 hours.
* Nodes are the easiest entry to zCOMB to gain revenue from the entire ecosystem.
* Custome FTM RPC endpoints to use in Metamask to avoid FTM network congestion and speed up transactions.
