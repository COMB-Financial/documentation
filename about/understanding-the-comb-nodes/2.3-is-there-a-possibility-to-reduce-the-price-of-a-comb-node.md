# 2.3 - Is there a possibility to reduce the price of a COMB node?

Not at this stage however, we are planning on introducing COMB-FTM LP staking, so if you are unable to afford a node, this is an alternative solution to build your <mark style="color:yellow;">**COMB**</mark> balance until you can afford a node.

\
We have also introduced our <mark style="color:yellow;">enhanced nodes</mark> to cover more price ranges.
