# 2.15 - How do I use my endpoint?

COMB offers both regular endpoints and universal endpoints.

Follow these steps to utilize your endpoints:\
&#x20;  1\. Connect your wallet to the dApp\
&#x20;  2\. Scroll down and click on "Generate Endpoint" next to your hive\
&#x20;  3\. Wait and refresh on occasion, clicking "Pending" will refresh too\
&#x20;  4\. Once generated, click on "Node Endpoint"\
&#x20;  5\. To use your endpoint go to MetaMask, and in your networks, change\
&#x20;       out the RPC url to your "https" endpoint! If you're a developer, you \
&#x20;       may use it as your JsonRPC url.
