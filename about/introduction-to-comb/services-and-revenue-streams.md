# Services and Revenue Streams

**Pools:** Users can stake their SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, and Beethoven-x LP tokens on https://app.comb.financial/pools and earn our native token, COMB, as a reward. **** LP tokens staked in our pools will be deployed to our strategy contracts and staked in our partner’s pools to generate yields, which are then redistributed to zCOMB holders through our Revenue-Sharing Vault.

**Yield Optimizers:** Users can stake their SpookySwap and Solidly LP tokens on [https://app.comb.financial/yield-optimizer](https://app.comb.financial/yield-optimizer) for increased amount of LP tokens as a reward. By taking a smaller percentage of commission, we are able to provide higher APYs. Fees generated are directed towards team allocation and redistributed to zCOMB holders through our Revenue-Sharing Vault.

**Fantom Validator Node:** Comb Financial maintains a Fantom validator node (#93) with 500,000 FTM staked. Users can delegate additional FTM to Comb’s validator node by following the instructions at [https://stakefantom.com/](https://stakefantom.com/) .The staked and delegated FTM generates rewards which are allocated to different investment, typically voted on by zCOMB holders at [https://snapshot.org/#/comb-finance.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/comb-finance.eth). By extending the 2 year lock on staked FTM twice daily, Comb Financial is able to achieve the highest APY of any Fantom validator node in the ecosystem.

**Hives:** Comb Financial has produced a limited number of hives which produce COMB at 6-hour intervals. Users can utilise a unique RPC-endpoint for access to the Fantom network, and will be able to enjoy further utility with future expansion. Hives are fNFTs and can be bought and sold on our marketplace.

**Podz:** Users can create Podz, which are essentially Generation 2 Nodes. Users can purchase Podz from Comb Financial or from our Marketplace and enjoy rewards in tokens other than COMB. As of May 2022, Podz currently offer rewards in BTC, ETH, and FTM. Rewards for Podz users come from the revenue-sharing vault, which means that an increased number of Podz sold will have non-inflationary effects on the COMB token.

**NFT Marketplace:** Users can buy or sell Hives and Podz on the Marketplace. Hives are no longer being produced and will only be available on the Marketplace. A 7.5% transaction fee is applied on all transfers to the Development and Marketing wallet.

**Metaverse (To Be Released):** Users will be able to interact and participate in the Comb ecosystem via a metaverse.

**P2E Game (To Be Released ETA Q3** **2022):** Users will be able to utilise COMB as part of a trading card game with details to be released in due time.

**Launchpad (To Be Released ETA Q2** **2022):**  Protocols will be able to leverage on Comb’s Launchpad with details to be released in due time.

**Savings Vaults** **(To Be Released ETA Q2** **2022):**  Users will be able to deposit stablecoins for yield.

**Stablecoin (To Be Released After Savings Vaults):** Users will be able to deposit their stablecoins for yield, and this will form the base before the lending protocol is released.

**Bridge (To Be Released ETA Q4 2022 TBD):** As of May 2022, there is currently only one bridge servicing the Fantom Network – [https://multichain.xyz/](https://multichain.xyz/). Users will be able to utilise Comb’s bridge to other networks – with the first networks to be bridged to being non-ERC20 networks such as Filecoin and Bitcoin Cash.
