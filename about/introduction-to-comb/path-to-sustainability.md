## Comb Financial Shift For Sustainability&#x20;

Comb’s launch into DeFi as a Nodes-As-A-Service protocol proved highly successful, as did the launch of Comb’s pools and Yield Optimizers. However, the extremely high rate of node (AKA Hive) creation led to an excessive COMB emissions rate. This emission rate was curbed by introducing a limit on node emissions of 12500x per day, and a reduction in hive rewards to 86% APR after ROT (Return On Token). Through these actions, the daily selling pressure will be reduced so as to allow for positive price action.

Currently, we are partnered with four leading DEXs (Decentralised EXchanges) on the Fantom network to achieve the following objectives:

* Increase TVLs on SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Beethoven-x and Solidex while giving more utility to users of the Comb Ecosystem.
* Provide daily yields for our zCOMB holders in $SPIRIT, $BOO, $BEETS, and $SOLID, and
* Collaborate for long-term growth in the Fantom Ecosystem.

We are also working with Rubic, a DEX aggregator.

We aim to bring the highest possible yields to our investors in the safest possible way.
