# 3.2 - Why is there another token?

The reason behind the second token is primarily due to one reason: **progression**.

<mark style="color:orange;">**NECT**</mark> is a wrapped ERC20 pegged to <mark style="color:yellow;">**COMB**</mark>. For every <mark style="color:orange;">**NECT**</mark>, there will always be a <mark style="color:yellow;">**COMB**</mark> to back it. The token has only one function: to create more hives.
