# 3.3 - Can I change my NECT into COMB?

<mark style="color:orange;">**NECT**</mark> may not be manually unwrapped, it must either be unwrapped by either a compounder contract/wallet or an administrator. However, there is one slight backdoor. In the case that a holder must urgently unwrap their <mark style="color:orange;">**NECT**</mark>, there is a function named `emergencyUnwrap` on the contract in which the holder may unwrap their <mark style="color:orange;">**NECT**</mark>.
