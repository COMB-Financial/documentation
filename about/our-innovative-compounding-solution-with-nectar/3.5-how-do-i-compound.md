Press the “Compound to NECTAR” button and sign the transaction to receive <mark style="color:orange;">**$NECT**</mark>. Once the transaction has been mined, you will have received <mark style="color:orange;">**$NECT**</mark>! In addition, you may also see the current balance from within your wallet.

As stated before, <mark style="color:orange;">**NECT**</mark> is 1:1 with <mark style="color:yellow;">**COMB**</mark>, therefore, the price of all hives in <mark style="color:yellow;">**COMB**</mark> will be the same price in <mark style="color:orange;">**NECT**</mark>. Once you have earned enough <mark style="color:orange;">**NECT**</mark> to purchase your hive of choice, go ahead and press “Create Hive”.

Given that you have sufficient <mark style="color:orange;">**NECT**</mark>, type in the name of your new hive and press “Create with NECTAR”. Sign the transaction and once its mined, you will have created a new hive with <mark style="color:orange;">**NECTAR**</mark>!
