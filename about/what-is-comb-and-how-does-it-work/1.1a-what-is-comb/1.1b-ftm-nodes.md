# 1.1b - FTM nodes

FTM is a proof of stake blockchain. In short, this means they use validator nodes to help verify actions on the network and runs things smoothly. \
\
There are a few options people can take to assist and profit off of this, as running one, or assisting in running a node is rewarded with $FTM.&#x20;

As of early January, we are still gathering enough treasury to get full validator nodes up and running. Currently, we are allocating capital to assist in running validator nodes to generate extra yield. \
\
Depending on the average node tier, we will be able to implement our own COMB community validator node when we reach 8000 nodes. Note we are still generating yield in the mean time as we head towards this first goal. \

More information can be found in the discord if anything is unclear. Just ask one of our mods or admins, someone will be happy to elaborate on any points that you need clarification on.
