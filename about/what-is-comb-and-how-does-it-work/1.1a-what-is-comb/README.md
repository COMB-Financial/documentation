# 1.1a - What is COMB?

COMB has been designed to open the doors of DeFi to anyone, through a multi-chain Yield Processing Node.

To put it in a nutshell, we aim to do <mark style="color:yellow;">**DeFi-as-a-Service**</mark>. Instead of navigating blindly between the 300 different protocols (and scams) in DeFi, you would just have to use one token and **one platform : **<mark style="color:yellow;">**COMB**</mark>.

Basically, the idea behind this project is to enable noders to invest into more DeFi protocols, without having to find the best ones all by themselves. Without running any software or having to pay for the network fees, do the manual swapping, bridging, staking, bonding, etc.

This means that you will be able to take advantage of a large variety of yield-generating protocols, without having to find the best ones yourself and conduct due-diligence, and without having to pay for the fees of each platform.

This protocol will be governed by noders who will vote towards which protocol to allocate which % of the funds. However, each investment in a protocol would be verified by COMB Nodes algorithms, so that noders do not take any risk with their investment.\
