## Impetus for Pools

The NaaS concept proved useful for raising capital, but was unsustainable due to an extremely high emission rate of protocol tokens. In order to move towards a sustainable system of revenue generation and revenue sharing with investors, Comb Financial utilised treasury funds to fund the development and initial liquidity provision in multiple pools which leveraged on SpiritSwap, SpookySwap and Beethoven-X.

By rewarding users who staked their LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens in the Comb Financial pools with $COMB, users are able to enjoy significantly higher APRs than they would in the origin pools.

Comb Financial deposits the LP tokens directly into the origin pools in order to yield rewards in $SPIRIT, $BOO, and $BEETS. These rewards are directed towards zCOMB and Podz investors to allow for sustainable growth.

## Pool Mechanism

A diagram of how pools aid in Comb Financialâ€™s sustainability is shown below. Comb Financial Pools emit 225 $COMB per day as of May 2022 and contribute to slight inflation.

## Investor Suitability

Comb Financial Farms are suitable for investors who prefer to be rewarded in $COMB in order to gain exposure to $COMB price action either for sale at market prices or to lock into zCOMB/ Podz for continuous revenue.
