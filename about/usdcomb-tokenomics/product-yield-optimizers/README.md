# Product: Yield Optimizers

Comb Financial’s Yield Optimizers allow users to stake their LP tokens for rewards in more LP tokens instead of rewards in $COMB. Comb Financial groups large numbers of LP tokens together and compounds the rewards every 30 minutes, allowing compound interest to take effect and greatly increase the strategy’s APY.

See below for a schematic on the mechanics behind Comb Financial’s Yield Optimizers:

## Investor Suitability

Yield Optimizers are suitable for investors inclined to accumulate more of their existing assets, in the form of LP Token, without exposure the $COMB price fluctuations or the wider Comb Ecosystem.
