# Product: Fantom Validator Node

## The Impetus for A Fantom Validator Node

The Fantom Network is a relatively young network and is highly undervalued in view of the TVL on the Fantom Ecosystem. In order to support the growing network and gain rewards in FTM, Comb Financial set up a Fantom Validator Node. The validator node also supports our hives’ RPC endpoints.

## Fantom Validator Node Revenue Flow

## Investor Suitability

Investors, especially Comb Financial investors, who wish to delegate FTM to a Fantom Validator Node should do so with a well maintained Validator, run by a professional company. This is because delegated and staked FTM can be slashed in the event of poor Validator performance. Comb Financial’s validator has an extremely high uptime with 0s downtime recorded.
