# Thank you.

We would like to say thank you to every one of you that joined and believed in the protocol since day one. Hopefully enough time has passed for people to realize that we are not a rug pull and we genuinely want to see everybody succeed. As with much of DeFi, there will always be losers and winners, but in this protocol we want to see the people that believed in us since day one to bee-come a winner. We appreciate your time, your efforts, and hope for you to have an amazing rest of your day/night. Keep buzzing üêù
