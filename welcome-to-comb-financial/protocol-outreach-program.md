# Protocol Outreach Program

With projects originating from the node space slowly leaving, we would like to remind you that we are here to stay, and we are building. Even with nodes becoming an essential part of our ecosystem to this day.

For those without a community, we welcome everybody with open arms.

If you are part of a community that is shutting down due to inability to navigate the current market conditions, we would like to welcome you to Comb Financial. We are even willing to risk yield dilution in the short term in order to prove to you that sustainable passive income IS possible in DeFi.

You can reach out to us by submitting a ticket to Discord. Share which project you are with, the current situation with the project, and an invite link to your project. Do also let your community know that are providing further opportunities to all projects currently under siege by the bear market.
