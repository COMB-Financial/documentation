# Understanding the Yield Optimizer’s User Interface

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (22) (1).png>)

Clicking “Buy Token” brings you to the appropriate DEX for you to purchase your required constituent tokens – in this example, TOMB and FTM.

Clicking “Add Liquidity” brings you to the appropriate DEX’s Liquidity page for you to add constituent tokens and acquire appropriate LP tokens. Remember that in order to use our yield optimizers, you must not deposit the LP Tokens into the DEX. Instead, deposit the LP Tokens into Comb Financial’s Yield Optimizers.
