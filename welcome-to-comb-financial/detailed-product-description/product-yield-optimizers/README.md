# Product: Yield Optimizers

COMB Financial’s Yield Optimizers allow users to stake their LP tokens for rewards in more LP tokens instead of rewards in $COMB. Comb Financial groups large numbers of LP tokens together and compounds the rewards every 30 minutes, allowing compound interest to take effect and greatly increase the strategy’s APY.&#x20;

See below for a schematic on the mechanics behind Comb Financial’s Yield Optimizers:

## Investor Suitability

Yield Optimizers are suitable for investors inclined to accumulate more of their existing assets, in the form of LP Token, without exposure the $COMB price fluctuations or the wider Comb Ecosystem.
