## Yield Optimizers

Yield Optimizer rewards are taxed at lower rates than competitors. Deposits and Withdrawals into the yield optimizers are not taxed.

Yield Optimizer Userâ€™s expected APY is calculated excluding a total 4.5% performance fees, of which 4.25% of the fees is redirected to zCOMB investors and 0.25% is allocated towards development.

## Pools, zCOMB, Podz and Capsule Related Taxes

Pool rewards are not taxed. Deposits and Withdrawals into the pools are not taxed.

Deposits and Withdrawals into the zCOMB, Podz, and Capsules are not taxed unless $COMB is transferred from a Hive.

## Hive Related Taxes

Healthy hives emitted \~1076 $COMB per day at an average \~325% APR. Upon the reduction of hive / node rewards, the APR was decreased to 86% APR for hives that had achieved ROT (Return On Token). Withered hives are expected to emit \~285 $COMB per day at a steady 86% APR emission rate.
